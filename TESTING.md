# - components/MatterSelector.test.tsx
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Example with Playwright
npx playwright test

# Test scenarios:
# - Complete user flow
# - Authentication flow
# - Data persistence
# - E2EE functionality
```

## Test Data Setup

### Sample Test Data

];

// Test depositions
const testDepositions = [
  { 
    title: "Dr. Smith Deposition",
    deponent: "Dr. John Smith",
    date: "2024-02-15",
    caseName: "Smith v. Johnson"
